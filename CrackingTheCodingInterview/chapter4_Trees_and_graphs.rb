# Route Between Nodes:
# Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to and out whether there is a
# route between two nodes.

# Minimal Tree: Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algoÂ­
# rithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

# List of Depths: Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes
# at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).

# Check Balanced: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced.
# For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is de ned to be a tree such that
#  the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

# Validate BST: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

# Successor: Write an algorithm to  nd the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree.
# You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.

# Build Order: You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the second project is dependent on the  rst project). All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return an error.
# EXAMPLE
# Input:
# projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
# dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c) Output: f, e, a, b, d, c
