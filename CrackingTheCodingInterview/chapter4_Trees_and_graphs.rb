# Route Between Nodes:
# Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to and out whether there is a
# route between two nodes.

# Minimal Tree: Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algoÂ­
# rithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

# List of Depths: Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes
# at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).
